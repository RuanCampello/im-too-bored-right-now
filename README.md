## Getting Started

As a person with ADHD, I frequently find myself without an ideia of what to do. 
Thinking about that and searching, I became aware of Bored API (https://www.boredapi.com).
I, therefore, decided to use this API to help people like me or someone who just doesn't have anything to do and is too bored right now.
This is the simplest web app possible, you only need to click on "Give me something to do!" and will be shown some suggestion, with its type, accessibility, price (0 obviously means free) and number of participants.
I hope this helps you out somehow, have fun!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
